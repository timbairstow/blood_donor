Could be extended in future but my two main things are:

2) When can I give blood?
Some situations mean you may have to wait before you can give blood, such as travel to some destinations, some medical conditions and procedures and some situations that increase the risk of contaigens.

4) How can I find out about blood doning in the UK?

5) What types of donation are there?
The most common is:
Whole blood: [https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/how-to-donate/types-of-blood-donations/whole-blood-donation.html]
Power red: US thing. Twice as much blood can be donated safely using a special machine that returns plasma and platelets back to the donor.
Platelet donation: 

What [is/are]:
Whole Blood donation: https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/how-to-donate/types-of-blood-donations/whole-blood-donation.html
“Whole blood” is simply the blood that flows through your veins. It contains red cells, white cells, and platelets, suspended in plasma. 
"whole blood"|"blood"|"normal" donation - This is the raw blood that flows in your veins, consisting of red and white cells, platelets, suspended in a plasm.
Platelet Donation: https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/how-to-donate/types-of-blood-donations/platelet-donation.html
This is where you donate platelets from your bloodstream. It can only be done in a specialist center and takes much longer than a normal blood donation due to the time it takes to seperate the platelets.
Plasma Donation: https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/how-to-donate/types-of-blood-donations/plasma-donation.html
Particularly useful for rare blood types, such as AB, this type of donation requires a specialist center and takes a little longer than normal blood donation. In this situation, only plasma is removed from the donor's bloodstream, returning platelets and red blood cells and some additional back.
Whole blood: This is the raw blood which is made up of 
Plasma: [http://www.hematology.org/Patients/Basics/]
- the liquid component of blood... a mixture of water, sugar, fat, protein and salts
 https://www.myvmc.com/anatomy/blood-function-and-composition/
 - mixture of proteins, encymes, nutrients, wastes, hormones and gases
 http://www.donatingplasma.org/donation/what-is-plasma
 - contains water, salts, enzymes, antibodies and other proteins.
 
Platelets [http://www.hematology.org/Patients/Basics/]
- Also called thrombocytes, actually not cells, but rather fragments of cells, their purpose is to help blood clotting.
Red Blood Cells|RBCs|erythrocytes [http://www.hematology.org/Patients/Basics/]
- red blood cells or erythrocytes contain hemoglobin, a protein containing iron, and are responsible for transporting oxygen and waste carbon dioxide around the body
White Blood Cells|leukocytes|WBCs [http://www.hematology.org/Patients/Basics/]
 - white blood cells or leukocytes protect the body from infrection. The most common is a neutrophil cell, a short-lived "immediate response" cell, the next major type are lymphocytes, two main groups being T-lymphocytes and B lymphocytes
 




How long does it take to give:
- Depending on admission/paperwork and setup, usually 
 [whole|blood] - about 30 minutes
 [plasma] - over an hour
 [platelet] - over 3 hours
 

I gave blood [yesterday/today], please make a note.
